        <h3>
          Hi, my name is Rony Rom!
        </h3>

        <h4>
          I was born and raised in Haifa, Israel (except for the 3 years we
          lived in New Jersey, NY in the early 90’s). Before becoming a UX/UI
          Designer, I worked as an Optometrist (the person who checks your
          vision and tells you that you need glasses).
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Why UX/UI Design?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Technology, computers, and other geeky stuff is something I always had
          an affinity for. As the one who was always fixing things around, it
          was just a matter of time for me to leave my previous profession and
          find myself doing what I enjoy the most: coming up with simple techy
          solutions for daily struggles. I design pleasurable User Experiences,
          consistent User Interfaces, and smart interactions.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Currently...
        </h3>
        <h4>
          …I’m teaching UX/UI Design at Ironhack, Berlin which allows me to
          develop my skills and enrich my knowledge in design. I'm now looking
          for my next challenge as I want to keep on learning and growing. What
          excites me is giving the users a great experience through smooth and
          clean interaction design.
        </h4>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Why Berlin?
        </h3>
        <h4>
          Well, I arrived not so long ago for studies and stayed because of a
          work opportunity. During this time I found out that I enjoy living in
          Berlin and generally in Europe. Even though Berlin is great, I'm open
          to relocate and discover new places.

          & food in general.
